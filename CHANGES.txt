  * Version 0.4.6

  * Hotfix release for OCaml 4.03.0 (Closes: #1519).

  * Major changes:

   * Create patch functions to mimic the new String.lowercase_ascii,
     String.uppercase_ascii, String.capitalize_ascii and
     String.uncapitalize_ascii found in OCaml 4.03.0
   * Disable tests depending on not yet buildable units with OCaml 4.03.0 (e.g.
     expect which depends on batteries, which doesn't yet compile)
   * Minimal version of OCaml is now 3.12.1. (Debian Wheezy version)


2014-10-22  Jacques-Pascal Deplaix <jp.deplaix AT gmail.com>

  * Version 0.4.5

  * Major changes:

    * Build and install annotation files.
    * Use builtin bin_annot and annot tags.
    * Tag .mly files on the same basis as .ml and .mli files
      (required by menhir).
    * Remove 'program' constraint from C-dependencies.
      Currently, when a library has C-sources and e.g. an executable
      depends on that library, then changing the C-sources and running
      '-build' does not yield a rebuild of the library.
      By adding these dependencies (rather removing the constraint),
      it seems to work fine.


  * Minor changes:

    * Add tests tag if --enable-tests.
    * Remove ocaml 4.02 warnings.
    * Fix the automatic use of -syntax for OCamlVersion >= 3.12.1.
    * Use the right ocamlfind binary to get all supported packages.
      The name of the ocamlfind binary should be read from the configuration.
      This is especially useful when cross-compiling.

  * Features:

    * no_automatic_syntax (alpha): Disable the automatic inclusion
      of -syntax camlp4o for packages that matches the internal heuristic
      (if a dependency ends with a .syntax or is a well known syntax).

    * compiled_setup_ml (alpha): Fix a bug using multiple arguments
      to the configure script.


  Thanks to Christopher Zimmermann, Jerome Vouillon, Tomohiro Matsuyama
  and Christoph HÃ¶ger for their pull requests and to help release this version.

  * Version 0.4.4

  * Quick bug fix release:

    * Don't skip some "\n\n" in Makefile/META/myocamlbuild.ml/setup.ml. This
      bug makes `oasis setup` think that these files have changed even if they
      have just been regenerated. (Closes: #1382).

2014-03-25  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain AT le-gall.net>

  * Version 0.4.3

  * Major changes:

    * Added -remove switch to the setup-clean subcommand designed to remove
      unaltered generated files completely, rather than simply emptying their
      OASIS section.
    * Translate path of ocamlfind on Windows to be bash/win32 friendly.
    * Description is now parsed in a more structured text (para/verbatim).

  * Minor changes:

    * Give a more precise message when module name are wrong (Closes: #1236).
    * Prevent loop in transitive_closure computation (Closes: #1253).
    * Update HACKING.md to define how to do a release and add some version
      and backward compatibility requirements.
    * No timeout for ocaml-expect, to prevent flaky tests on slow architecture.
    * Prevent warnings from confusing the terminal, add some extra \n.
    * Force to use the ocamlfind define in configure. (Closes: #1360)
    * Add more descriptive message when indentation is wrong (Closes: #1295)

  * Features:

    * stdfiles_markdown (alpha): set default extension of StdFiles (AUTHORS, INSTALL,
      README) tp be '.md'. Use markdown syntax for standard files. Use comments
      that hides OASIS section and digest. This feature should help direct
      publishing on GitHub.

    * disable_oasis_section (alpha): it allows DisableOASISSection to be
      specified in the package with a list of expandable filenames given. Any
      generated file specified in this list doesn't get an OASIS section digest
      or comment headers and footers and is therefore regenerated each time
      oasis setup is run (and any changes made are lost).
      This feature is mainly intended for use with StdFiles so that, for
      example, INSTALL.txt and AUTHORS.txt (which often won't be modified) can
      have the extra comment lines removed.

    * compiled_setup_ml (alpha): allow to precompile setup.ml to speedup.


  Thanks to David Allsopp, Martin Keegan and Jacques-Pascal Deplaix for their
  pull requests and to help release this version.


2014-02-23  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain AT le-gall.net>

  * Version 0.4.2

  * Major changes:

    * Change BSD3 and BSD4 to BSD-3-clause and BSD-4-clause to comply with
      DEP5, add BSD-2-clause. BSD3 and BSD4 are still valid but marked as
      deprecated.
      More information:
      http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/#license-specification

    * Enhance .cmxs supports through the generation of .mldylib files.
      When one of the modules of a library has the name of the library,
      ocamlbuild tends to just transform this module into a .cmxs. Now, the use
      of a .mldylib fix that problem and the .cmxs really contains all modules
      of the library.

    * Refactor oasis.cli to be able to create subcommand plugins.
      * Exported modules starts now with CLI.
      * Display plugins in the manual.
      * Design so that it is possible to be thread-safe.
      * Try to minimize the number of functions.
      * Make better choice of name and API.
      * A subcommand plugin 'dist' to create tarball is in preparation, as a
        separate project.

    * Remove plugin-list subcommand, this command was limited and probably not
      used. A better alternative will appear in next version.

    * Sub-command setup-dev is now hidden and will soon be removed.

  * Minor changes:

    * Refactor ocamlbuild build plugin to have some features in doc plugin.
      XOCamlbuilExtraArgs and XOCamlbuildPluginTags are now available for
      Document. The flag '-use-ocamlfind' is set for doc and build plugin.

    * Reorganize the test/data directory, each toplevel test has now its
      dedicated subdirectory in test/data.

    * Start to work on better support of syntax extension:
      * Remove archive(syntax,{byte,native}) from the META, this was causing
        an issue when trying to compile.
      * Add an example that creates a syntax extension.
      * Add support for auto-guessing syntax_camlp4o when one of the syntax
        extension shipped with camlp4 is in a build depends.

    * Allow to include $(X) in CCOpt/CClib.
      This patch helps to enable variable susbtitution for flags. This allow to
      write a PostConfCommand script to insert this data in setup.data and have
      them back when running OCamlbuild.

    * Raise error when "true" or "false" are not spelled correctly.

    * Fix some warnings about "Field X is set but matcing plugin Z is not enabled."

  Thanks to Andrew Ferguson, Florent Monnier and Jacques-Pascal Deplaix for their
  pull requests and to help release this version.


2013-12-19  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain AT le-gall.net>

  * Version 0.4.1

  * Major changes:

     * Fix broken compilation with threads and OCaml >= 4.01 (Closes: #1358)

  * Minor changes:

    * Refactor plugins for command line interface.
    * Get rid of message 'field is set but no matching plugin' (Closes: #795, #1043).

  * Features:

    * dynrun_for_release (alpha):
      * The goal of this plugin is to allow creating release with a minimal
        setup.ml that uses '-setup-update dynamic'.
      * Refactor setup.ml to perform early checks. like looking for findlib
        and oasis.dynrun library and warns the user in case they cannot be
        found (early configure script).
      * Along setup.ml, Makefile and configure, also keep INSTALL.txt if
        StdFiles plugins is used to provide a readable list of package to
        install.

  * Addendum to 0.4.0 release:
    * Since 0.4.0 OASIS has a limited support to syntax extension. If in the
      list of BuildDepends, one of the library ends with ".syntax", OASIS will
      add the tag "syntax_camlp4o" to all files of this library. This new
       feature already covers some common case of using syntax extensions.


2013-12-13  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain AT le-gall.net>

  * Version 0.4.0

  * Major changes:

     * Migrate the source repository to https://github.com/ocaml/oasis
     * Fix a lot of code style issues (e.g. blank at the end of the line) and
       create a test to check that the style of generated files is correct. Some
       related tools has been fixed asi well, for the best formatting use
       ocamlmod >= 0.0.7 and ocaml-data-notation >= 0.0.10.
     * Port all tests to OUnit 2.0, which allows to run all tests faster.
     * Run some tests with a fake bytecode only setup, so that we can always
       check that bytecode and nativecode tests are passing.  (Closes: #1306)
     * Fix a missing dependency on ocamlbuild package and inclusion of
       ocambuildlib.cma in builtin-plugins.cma.
     * Introduce a framework to create features.
       * Add fields AlphaFeatures and BetaFeatures to list the experimental
         features you want to use in your _oasis
       * Using AlphaFeatures and BetaFeatures is only allowed if OASISFormat is
         set to the latest OASIS version. There is no backward compatiblity for
         experimental features. For example, if you are using OASIS 0.4.X,
         OASISFormat must be set to 0.4.
       * AlphaFeatures represents features not fully completed that maybe very
         unstable, quickly evolving and even removed in future release.
       * BetaFeatures represents features almost finished that needs to mature
         a bit before being published.
       * See 'Features' section in this changelog to have a list of what
         features are available.

  * Minor changes:
     * Self compile during tests.
     * Apply patches found in vouillon/opam-android-repository.
     * Fix bug when a directory with the right name appears in the PATH.
     * Fix OASISPath_intern.fn_reader on Cygwin.
     * Fix suffix_program on Cygwin.
     * Fix the META generation when XMETAType: syntax.
     * Fix for installing .cmx files with packed libraries as required for
       cross-module inlining.
     * Fix bad location of .cmx generated along .cmxs.
     * Add GNU Affero GPL license
     * Add the wtfpl license
     * Fix typos, thanks to Hendrik Tews.
     * Locate "topfind" when using opam "system" compiler.
     * Fix issue (Closes: #1239)
     * Assume camlp4o when packages end in .syntax.
     * Make sure the right Findlib version is used with OCaml 4.0.0.
     * Fix strange split function in myocamlbuild (Closes: #1186)

  * Features:

     * section_object (beta):
        * Implement 'Object' section, thanks to Philippe Veber

     * pure_interface (alpha):
        * Support pure interface modules in libraries.

     * ocamlbuild_more_args (alpha):
        * Add field XOCamlbuildPluginTags to pass -plugin-tags to OCamlbuild
        * Add field XOCamlbuildExtraArgs to pass more args to OCamlbuild


2012-06-28  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain AT le-gall.net>

  * Version 0.3.0

  * EXTREMLY IMPORTANT changes (read this):

    * Fix bug with scanf %S@\n for ocaml 4.00. We were unfortunetaly using an
      undocumented tolerance of Scanf in the previous version. You should
      consider making new release using this version that fixed this.

      PACKAGES uploaded to oasis-db will be automatically "derived" before
      OCaml 4.00 release (i.e.  oUnit v1.1.1 will be regenerated with this new
      version as oUnit v1.1.1~oasis1).

      PACKAGES not uploaded to oasis-db need to be regenerated. In order not to
      break 3rd party tools that consider a tarball constant, I recommend to
      create a new version.

      Thanks to INRIA OCaml team for synchronizing with us on this point.

  * Major changes:

    * Handle the field "Pack: true" to be able to create packed libraries. It
      also installs .mli files for documentation into the target directory.
      The pack option is only supported for "OASISFormat: 0.3", you will need
      to update the version of your _oasis file to match it.


    * Introduce --[enable|disable]-[tests|docs] to disable tests and docs at
      oasis level. It seems a very common pattern to have a "Flag tests" to
      turn off by default the tests. This is now define as a standard var and
      you should remove you previous "Flag tests" but you can continue to
      use "flag(tests)" where needed.

      You can now have the following example:
      ...

      Executable test_exec
        Install: false
        Build$: flag(tests)
        MainIs: testExec.ml
        BuildDepends: oUnit

      Test main
        Command: $test_exec
        TestTools: test_exec

      ...

      The "Run$: flag(tests)" is implicit for the section "Test main". The
      default value is "false" for tests. If all the executable for test are
      flagged correctly (Build$: flag(tests)), you'll get rid of the dependency
      on oUnit.

      It works the same for documentation, however the default is "true".
      (Closes: #866)

    * Allow to define interdependent flags

       In order to allow interdependent flags, we transform back lazy values into
       'unit -> string' functions. This allows to change a flag value on the
       command line and to update all the dependent values.
       (Closes: #827, #938)

    * Deprecate the subcommand 'oasis setup-dev' in favor of
      'oasis setup -setup-update {none|weak|dynamic}'

      It defines different ways to manage the auto-update of setup.ml:
      * 'none': this is the default mode, and the one you should use when
         distributing tarballs. No update are performed at al.
      * 'weak': the update is only triggered when something change in `_oasis`,
         we keep all files generated
      * 'dynamic': the content of 'setup.ml' is ultra small (<2kB) and we only
         keep a small 'setup.ml', 'Makefile' and 'configure'.

      The choice between 'weak' and 'dynamic' depends on your need with
      regard to VCS and to the presence of `oasis'. The 'weak' allow to checkout
      the project from VCS and be able to work on it, without the need of
      installing 'oasis' as long as you don't change the file '_oasis'. But it
      clutter your VCS history with changes to the build system each time you
      change something in '_oasis'. The 'dynamic' mode gives you no VCS history
      pollution but makes mandatory to have installed oasis libraries.

    * Don't copy executable in ocamlbuild

      Avoid copying executable to their real name. It helps to call ocamlbuild a
      single time for the whole build rather than calling it n time (n = number
      of executable sections) and copying resulting exec.

      This speeds up the build process because ocamlbuild doesn't have to
      compute/scan dependencies each time.

      The drawback is that you have to use $foo when you want to call
      "Executable foo", because $foo will be _build/.../main.byte.

    * Change the way we parse command line like option (CCOpt, CCLib and the like). We have
      implemented a real POSIX command line parser, except that variables are processed by
      Buffer.add_substitute (except if correctly escaped, using
      Buffer.add_substitute escaping).

      For example:
        CCOpt: -DEXTERNAL_EXP10 -L/sw/lib "-framework vecLib"

      Will be parsed correctly and outputed according to target OS.

    * Externalize ocamlmod in its own project, which become a dependencies.

    * Minimize the dependencies of the project.

      In order to ease building oasis, we have minimize the number of dependencies.
      You only need to install ocamlmod, ocamlify and ocaml-data-notation for a
      standard build without tests. Dependencies on pcre, extlib and ocamlgraph has
      been dropped. The remaining dependencies are hidden behind a flag "tests".

    * Implement proposal for handling plugin in META, using "plugin" extra directives

      oasis now produces .cmxs file by default and add them to META.

      Now a META looks like:

      ...
      archive(byte) = "oasis.cma"
      archive(byte, plugin) = "oasis.cma"
      archive(native) = "oasis.cmxa"
      archive(native, plugin) = "oasis.cmxs"
      ...

      This will ultimately help to generate automatically .cmxs for all oasis enabled
      projects. We hope that this new feature will improve dynamic linking use
      in OCaml (esp. for project like Ocsigen).

  * Other changes:

    * Produce only subcommands specific helps when asked (Closes: #783)
    * Use pager for long textual output (Closes: #782)
    * Give the help summary directly when running just "oasis" (Closes: #781)
    * Remove `pwd` filename prefix to avoid too long command line on Windows (Closes: #1007)
    * Install required .cmx when installing libraries (Closes: #686, #885)
    * Retain blanks at the beginning of line in freeform (Closes: #811)
    * Allow PreConfCommand to create setup.data with any variables inside (Closes: #823)
    * Allow to use setup.data in shell script and Makefile (Closes: #982)
    * Fix execute permissions (Closes: #980)
    * Drop extra version in ocaml version (Closes: #964, #888)
    * Always output info messages on stderr (Closes: #785)
    * Fix interversion in version comparator lexer (Closes: #808)
    * Document the fact that setup.data is mandatory (Closes: #946)
    * configure translates getopt command line to Arg (Closes: #778, #804)
    * Generate valid META when there are line breaks in synopsis (Closes: #933)
    * Keep owner of generated files (Closes: #793)
    * Set -I +threads for ocamlfind ocamldoc in ocamlbuild (Closes: #949)
    * Exclude VCS directories by default (Closes: #847)
    * Print the configure summary in the "normal" order.
    * Merge findlib virtual containers with the same name
    * Synchronize plugin data for section
    * Improve documentation
    * Verify validity of input when parsing in quickstart (Closes: #797)
    * Fix stack overflow when there are twice the same library (Closes: #1130)
    * Parse license examples for DEP5 specification (Closes: #1102)
    * Be ultra-liberal regarding version syntax (allow '_' and ' ' in the version).
    * Allow to add extra content to META files (XMETAExtraLines)
    * Allow to use executable name that contains "-" as a variable (replacing "-" by "_").


    Thanks to Anil Madhavapeddy, Pierre Chambart, Christophe Troestler,
    Jeremie Dimino, Ronan Le Hy, Yaron Minsky and Till Varoquaux for their help
    with this release.

    Also thanks to all the testers of the numerous release candidates. This
    was a long work and each time a tester has downloaded oasis has helped me
    to know that I was working for someone.

2010-10-16  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain.le-gall AT ocamlcore.com>

  * Version 0.2.0

  * Split the project into 3 libraries and one executable:
    * oasis: the core library
    * oasis.base: the runtime library
    * oasis.builtin-plugins: various plugins (ocamlbuild, internal, none, custom)
    * the executable 'oasis' in lowercase which was 'OASIS' before
      (Closes: #769)

  * Publish .mli and improve ocamldoc generated documentation (Closes: #667)

  * oasis library:
    * Ignore plugins even when parsing field
    * Allow to redirect messages through a function and use a context to avoid
      global variables. This is an OASIS-DB website requirement, but we fallback
      to a global variable in oasis.base
    * Use the same policy as Debian for version comparison (copied from dpkg)
      (Closes: #584)
    * Add MIT, CeCILL licenses and make unknown license less fatal
      (Closes: #710, #557)
    * Allow https, ftp, mailto, svn, svn+ssh for URL (Closes: #753)
    * Replace Str by Pcre
    * Don't modify package data structure through plugins, we just issue warnings
      and error when something is missing. This is compensated by a better
      'quickstart' that can automatically complete required fields (e.g. it adds
      'ocamlbuild' as a BuildDependency for 'ocamlbuild' plugin).
      (Closes: #552, #566)
    * Set default for test type to 'custom' plugin (Closes: #562)
    * Use a more simple lexer for _oasis (Closes: #579)
    * Warn if the use of '\t' to indent lines is inconsistent in an _oasis file
      (e.g. mix of ' ' and '\t')
    * Allow to use 'flag' as environment variables in _oasis (e.g. flag test can be used as
      Command: echo $test) (Closes: #619)
    * ADVANCED USERS: Create a new scheme to synchronize data between the
      property list used to parse and print an _oasis file and the data structure
      representing it. This is a first step to avoid carrying property lists
      inside the data structure.  It should also allow to dump plugin data
      directly inside the data structure rather than having to do it "by hand".
      This allows to have a more complete quickstart support also (i.e. handling
      plugins directly). It also allows to manipulate the datastructures in a
      single place: with the scheme before you have to update the property list
      and the rest of the datastructure. (Closes: #705, #733)

  * oasis.base library:
    * Exit with an error code when tests fail
    * Don't account skipped test (Closes: #624)
    * Delegate the "setup-dev" actions to the executable 'oasis' rather than
      embedding it into setup.ml
    * Add a '-version' to setup.ml to know what version has generated the file
      (Closes: #692)
    * Add a '-all' target that does "-configure", "-build", "-doc" and "-test"
      in one run (Closes: #551)
    * Add a '-reinstall' target that 'uninstall' and 'install' (Closes: #568)
    * Use the right command to delete file on Windows

  * executable 'oasis':
    * Use a subcommand scheme, like subversion. For example, it replaces the
      former "OASIS -setup" by "oasis setup". Each subcommand can be a small
      plugin
    * Add a "query" subcommand to extract data of _oasis from command line
      (Closes: #691)
    * Add a "setup-clean" subcommand that removes generated files and helps
      cleaning OASIS_START/STOP section of their content
      (Closes: #564, #623, #563)
    * Add a "check" subcommend that checks _oasis files
    * Greatly improve the "quickstart" subcommand:
      * Take into account plugins in quickstart
      * Allow to have multiple choices for field Plugins in quickstart mode
      * Don't display help text at each question (Closes: #586)
      * Allow to create a doc (Closes: #633)
      * Allow to run a pager, editor or "oasis setup-dev" at the end
        (Closes: #580, #582)
      * Don't accept '?' as an answer in quickstart (Closes: #587)
      * Add examples and all available licenses in the help of License field
        (Closes: #559)
    * Keep generated files when 'oasis setup-dev' is called (Closes: #743)

  * Plugin "ocamlbuild":
    * Handle "Path: ." in generated _tags correctly (Closes: #570, #588)
    * Quick fix to handle .h files directly in CSources field
    * Include .mli in _tags (Closes: #572)
    * Pass -cclib and -dllpath options to ocamlmklib  (Closes: #629)
    * Don't pass -dlllib and -dllpath options to ocamlopt (Closes: #628)

  * Plugin "internal":
    * Create parent directories when installing with InternalInstall (Closes: #555)
    * Don't install data when section is not built (Closes: #554, #556)

  * Plugin "META":
    * Add an exists_if field to generated META file (Closes: #694)


2010-04-08  Sylvain Le Gall <sylvain.le-gall AT ocamlcore.com>

 * Initial version 0.1.0
